                <code>I know this might come out of nowhere, and I completely understand if it feels sudden. But I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, after typing, retyping and backspacing, i decided to let it all out unlike last time in 2023 and I needed a way to let it out—it was getting heavy. So as you once told me I should work on refining my skills, I did. But this time, I ended up using it for something far more personal than professional. I’m not here with expectations—I just want to be honest, with full transparency. </code>

                <h2>How & When It All Started.</h2>
                <code><p>It goes way back to when you joined the group chat, around September or October 2022. I’ve liked you since then—before we even started talking. I admired you from afar. I wasn’t the type to always jump into chats, but I used to quietly join the conversation when you did. You might not remember much from then, or maybe you think your past decisions were questionable, but I remember exactly how I saw you back then: mature, focused, thoughtful. Even your voice notes from those days stuck with me.
                    We shared similar interests too, and that caught my attention. I didn’t just find you pretty or cute—it was deeper than that, we had not even added each other until January 2023 when you sent me the follow req and in the ss you can see how i reacted to that, anyways, I liked the way you carried yourself. We didn’t talk much, but I had a sense of the kind of person you were, and I admired that. Though at the time, I quietly backed off and kept those feelings to myself.
                    In late 2023, I got into a relationship. That went through a break November and ended permanently in January 2025. I took time to process everything and tried to move forward.
                    In February, I wished my ex a happy birthday with a sweet gesture as our breakup was recent then some things happened and i realised I had moved on, Three months after my breakup, On Eid, we started talking, and i had to wake up at 7 but when were talking I couldn’t help but notice that you’re exactly the kind of person I thought you'd be. I liked you even before we started talking, and it just became clearer to me the more we spoke so i just couldn't leave the conversation because i was into you, eventually the sun came up and you went, then the next two days went hectic and i could not talk to you properly and damn, the way i was thinking abt it.</strong></p> </code>

                    There were many reasons. At one point, I thought you were in a relationship, and I didn’t want to interfere. I also wasn’t into e-dating. It never felt right to me, it always seemed unserious and casual, and I’ve always been too genuine for that. I wasn’t ready to suddenly start simping or chasing without understanding if it was even the right thing to do. you seemed much more than that to me. I wasn’t sure if that would be the right way to go about it, so I kept my feelings to myself and eventually backed off.

                <code>I’m not someone who opens up easily. The things I’ve shared with you—I haven’t even shared with people in my real life. But with you, it felt natural. It felt safe. That’s how much I valued our conversations.
                    There were many times I wanted to say more, but I didn’t. Like when you’d tell me those brainrot jokes—I genuinely wanted to hear your voice more, so I’d say something like “these jokes would sound funnier in your voice.” And when you sent me that video, I kept looking at it, thinking, “Damn, you're so cute, i should totally get you ek nazar wala bracelet.” But I didn’t say anything because I was scared it’d creep you out or make you ghost me.
                    I even thought about asking for your number so I could just call you and say all this directly, but I felt it would come off as too much, too soon. I thought you wouldn’t be comfortable, and maybe you’d just disappear instead. So, again, I kept quiet.</code>

                    I have to be honest—when you ghosted me, it made me feel really uneasy. I started overthinking everything. One moment I was out with my friends sulking, the next I saw your notif pop up again and I was like, "Bata kya khayega?" I felt relieved.
                    But then again, you got distant. And then suddenly, you texted again. And I knew I couldn’t keep holding this in. I had to let you know how I felt.
                    Because it wasn’t just about talking to you. It was because of who you are.
                    Baat esi nahi ki koi baat karne wala nahi tha, baat esi h ki teri wali baat nahi thi kisi ki baaton me.
                    I’m not saying you misled me or anything like that. I just wanted to be honest and express my feeling because it was getting very heavy to hold on to, emo intelligent hu toh i know it's not mutual and maybe i should have kept it to myself but emo weak bhi hu toh i could not keep it to myself ab.</code>

                <code>I also have this idea of you being very casual abt it and the way you were with me might be the way you are w everyone tho what i felt was from way before so i dont want you to think i felt like this just because some of our conversations if you’ve read this far, I just ask for one thing—a simple acknowledgment saying "i read it" no need for anything more unless you feel like talking. I hope this doesn’t make you feel too overwhelmed. Thanks for reading, and take care. I truly value our conversations, no matter what happens, I hope things stay good between us.</code>
